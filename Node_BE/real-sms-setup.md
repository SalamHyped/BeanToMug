# Real SMS Delivery Setup for Phone Verification

## Problem: You're Not Receiving SMS Codes

Currently you're using sandbox credentials that don't deliver real SMS. Here are your options:

## Option 1: Switch to Twilio (Recommended)

Twilio has better international support and is more reliable for Israeli numbers.

### Step 1: Get Twilio Account
1. Go to [Twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Get your **Account SID** and **Auth Token**

### Step 2: Update Your Code
Replace Vonage with Twilio in your application.

## Option 2: Fix Vonage for Real SMS

### Step 1: Get Real Vonage Credentials
1. Go to [Vonage Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/)
2. Get your **real API Key** and **API Secret** (not sandbox)
3. Add credits to your account

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables
```env
VONAGE_API_KEY=your_real_api_key
VONAGE_API_SECRET=your_real_api_secret
VONAGE_FROM_NUMBER=your_vonage_phone_number
```

## Option 3: Email Verification (Immediate Solution)

Since SMS is having issues, let's implement email verification as a backup.

### Benefits:
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ No carrier issues
- ✅ More reliable
- ✅ No costs

## Option 4: WhatsApp Verification

Use WhatsApp Business API for verification codes.

## Quick Fix: Test with Email Verification

Would you like me to:
1. **Implement email verification** as a backup to SMS?
2. **Switch to Twilio** for better SMS delivery?
3. **Help you get real Vonage credentials**?
4. **Create a test mode** that shows verification codes in the console?
